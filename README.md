# hello-world-
I am an Automation QA Engineer, I specialize in UI testing using either UFT/QTP or Selenium, and a little bit of MySQL for test data creation.
Back in college/university I work on my thesis using Java, C#, PHP, and MySQL. Right now I'm trying to go back on track with my Java skills by practicing Java programming again.
I am also studying Android and Kotlin for I am planning to create an android app in the future.
